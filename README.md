# Genome540
Introduction to Computational Molecular Biology: Genome and Protein Sequence Analysis

Genome 540 is the first quarter of a two-quarter introduction to protein and DNA sequence analysis and molecular evolution, including probabilistic models of sequences and of sequence evolution, computational gene identification, pairwise sequence comparison and alignment (algorithms and statistical issues), multiple sequence alignment and evolutionary tree construction, comparative genomics, and protein sequence/structure relationships. These represent the central computational approaches for interpreting genomes. The statistical and algorithmic ideas discussed (which include maximum likelihood estimation, hidden Markov models, dynamic programming) have wide applicability in other areas of computational & mathematical biology as well.
